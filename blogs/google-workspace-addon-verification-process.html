  <h1>🚀 My First Google Workspace Add-On Went Live - Here's Exactly How the Verification Process Worked (And What I Wish I Knew Earlier)</h1>

  <p>When I started building my first Google Workspace Add-on - <strong>Form Prefiller</strong> - I thought the hardest part would be getting the code right.</p>

  <p>Spoiler: it wasn't.</p>

  <p>The real challenge was understanding Google's verification process - dozens of back-and-forth emails, unclear rejection notes, and hours spent tweaking OAuth scopes until everything finally lined up.</p>

  <p>If you're building your first add-on, this post will save you weeks of confusion.</p>

  <p>Here's exactly what the process looked like for me - what worked, what didn't, and what I wish someone had told me earlier.</p>

  <h2>💡 What I Built: Form Prefiller</h2>
  <p>Form Prefiller is a Google Forms™ add-on that helps automate form filling.</p>

  <p>It lets users upload a spreadsheet (CSV/Excel/Google Sheets), map their columns to Google Form fields, and automatically generate personalized pre-filled links - all at once.</p>

  <p>The idea came from watching schools, HR teams, and small businesses repeatedly fill the same forms with slightly different data.</p>

  <p>It started simple - a tool for generating pre-filled links - but soon grew to include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Support for all major field types:</strong> short answer, paragraph, multiple choice, checkbox, dropdown</li>
    <li><strong>AI-powered Smart Mapping:</strong> suggests field mappings automatically</li>
    <li><strong>Error validation:</strong> detects mismatched dropdown or checkbox values</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once I was happy with the product, it was time to publish it on the Google Workspace Marketplace.</p>

  <p>That's when the real learning began.</p>

  <h2>🧩 The Two-Step Verification Process</h2>
  <p>Google's review isn't a single step.</p>
  <p>There are actually <strong>two independent approval processes</strong>, handled by two different teams:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Step</th>
        <th>Reviewer</th>
        <th>What They Check</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1. OAuth Verification</td>
        <td>Google Cloud OAuth Team</td>
        <td>Data access, API scopes, privacy policy, security, external requests</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. Marketplace App Review</td>
        <td>Google Workspace Marketplace Team</td>
        <td>Functionality, UI quality, listing copy, icons, and user experience</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>You'll usually need both.</p>
  <p>If your add-on uses any sensitive or restricted scopes (and most do), OAuth verification must be completed first.</p>

  <h2>🔐 Part 1: The OAuth Verification Rollercoaster</h2>
  <p>I submitted my OAuth verification request, feeling confident.</p>
  <p>Two days later, the reply landed in my inbox:</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <em>"Please clarify why your app is requesting restricted scopes and provide a description of all external requests."</em>
  </div>

  <p>And that was just the beginning.</p>

  <p>Over the next few weeks, I received nearly <strong>20 emails</strong> from Google's verification team. Each one highlighted something small but critical - things I hadn't even realized mattered.</p>

  <p>Here's what I learned the hard way 👇</p>

  <h3>1️⃣ Pin Every External Endpoint</h3>
  <p>If your script calls any API outside of Google - like a web app endpoint or OpenAI API - you must pin those URLs using the <code>urlFetchWhitelist</code> field in your <code>appsscript.json</code>.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Document every external URL your add-on calls, even if it's just for logging or analytics.
  </div>

  <h3>2️⃣ Justify Every Scope - in Plain English</h3>
  <p>Each Google API scope you request must have a clear justification.</p>

  <p><strong>Example of what worked for me:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Read form structure to identify question titles and options for generating pre-filled links.</li>
    <li><strong>Specific Scope:</strong> <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.currentonly</code></li>
    <li><strong>Limited Use:</strong> Access is limited only to the currently open Google Form. No other forms are read or modified.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You'll need to do this for every scope - including Gmail (<code>gmail.send</code> or <code>gmail.compose</code>), Drive, and external requests.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Reviewers appreciate when your justification language mirrors Google's "Limited Use Policy." It shows you've done your homework.
  </div>

  <h3>3️⃣ Make Your Privacy Policy Reviewer-Friendly</h3>
  <p>This is where many developers stumble.</p>

  <p>Your privacy policy must be clear, specific, and hosted on a public domain (not a Google Doc).</p>

  <p>I hosted mine at:<br>
  👉 <a href="https://brightconstruct.co/form-prefiller#privacy-policy" target="_blank">brightconstruct.co/form-prefiller#privacy-policy</a></p>

  <p><strong>Make sure it includes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>What data your app accesses and why</li>
    <li>The exact scopes (listed in plain text)</li>
    <li>A "Limited Use" section referencing Google's API policy</li>
    <li>A link to revoke access: <code>https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>And yes - the reviewer will actually click the link to check.</p>

  <h3>4️⃣ Explain AI Usage Transparently</h3>
  <p>Because Form Prefiller uses OpenAI for Smart Mapping, I had to clarify that <strong>no user data or responses are sent</strong> - only form field names and spreadsheet headers.</p>

  <p>That one line made the difference between a 403 rejection and approval.</p>

  <h3>5️⃣ Expect Multiple Rounds (and Stay Patient)</h3>
  <p>It took me just over <strong>a month</strong> to get OAuth verification.</p>

  <p>Each email from Google added more clarity - about HTTPS security, data flow, or endpoint pinning.</p>

  <p>It was frustrating at times, but by the end, I understood my own system's privacy model far better than before.</p>

  <h2>🧾 Part 2: The Marketplace Review</h2>
  <p>Once OAuth verification was approved, I moved to the Marketplace App Review - and thankfully, this part was faster.</p>

  <p><strong>Here's what they checked:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sidebar opened and functioned inside Google Forms</li>
    <li>Logo icons followed size guidelines (32×32, 128×128, 256×256, etc.)</li>
    <li>Description accurately reflected functionality</li>
    <li>Screenshots and demo video worked</li>
    <li>Privacy policy and Terms of Service were accessible</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Marketplace team also installed my add-on, tested generating pre-filled links, and even checked the AI mapping pop-up.</p>

  <p>Within a week - I got the green light. ✅</p>

  <h2>⚡ What I Wish I Knew Earlier</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Document your scopes before building.</strong> It saves time when writing justifications later.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep one Google Sheet for reviewer communication.</strong> Log each feedback point and how you fixed it - it prevents missing details.</li>
    <li><strong>Make a 45-second demo video.</strong> Even a quick Youtube walkthrough reduces confusion for reviewers.</li>
    <li><strong>Use clear, polite language in replies.</strong> Reviewers are humans, not gatekeepers. Patience and clarity go a long way.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌱 What Happened Next</h2>
  <p>After approval, I released <strong>Smart Mapping</strong> - an AI-powered feature that automatically pairs form fields with spreadsheet columns.</p>

  <p>Already helping early adopters pre-fill Google Forms faster - teachers, HR teams, and small businesses included.</p>

  <p>The best part? Every scope, request, and dialog now fits within Google's verification framework cleanly. It's privacy-safe, transparent, and ready for scale.</p>

  <h2>🧭 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>If you're building your first Google Workspace Add-on, know this:</p>

  <p><strong>The review process isn't there to slow you down - it's there to make your product stronger and more trustworthy.</strong></p>

  <p>By the end of it, you'll have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A clear privacy policy</li>
    <li>Secure and transparent code</li>
    <li>A better understanding of your users' data</li>
    <li>And yes - a live add-on that you can proudly share with the world.</li>
  </ul>
