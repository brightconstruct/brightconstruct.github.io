                        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Bright Construct ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Google Workspace Add-on, Form Prefiller (the "Add-on"), which is designed to pre-fill Google Forms.</p>

                        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently. This policy explains our practices in detail.</p>

                                <h3>What Information We Collect and Why</h3>
                                <div class="section-content">
                                    <p>Our Add-on primarily functions by interacting with your Google Forms and Google Sheets data to facilitate the pre-filling process. We collect the minimum information necessary to provide and improve the Add-on's features.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Information you authorize us to access (via Google OAuth):</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>Your Google User ID and Email Address:</strong> This is collected to identify you as a user, manage your license (if applicable), and provide essential service communications (e.g., updates, support). This information is fundamental for the Add-on to operate within your Google Workspace environment. Specifically, your email address is also used as the "from" address when sending emails on your behalf, as initiated by you through the Add-on's features.</p>
                                    <p>Specific Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email</p>

                                    <p><strong>Google Sheets Spreadsheets (Read & Edit Access):</strong></p>
                                    <p>Purpose: The Add-on needs to read data from your specified Google Sheets spreadsheets to retrieve the values used for pre-filling. It also needs to write/edit data to your specified Google Sheets spreadsheets if you configure the Add-on to log usage, errors, or other relevant data back to a sheet, or to append the generated prefilled URLs to a sheet.</p>
                                    <p>Specific Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets (See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Sheets spreadsheets).</p>
                                    <p>Limited Use: Our access is strictly limited to the spreadsheets you explicitly select or connect with the Add-on. We do not access or process any other spreadsheets in your Google Drive unless you specifically authorize or direct the Add-on to do so.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Google Forms (Current Form - Read & Edit Access):</strong></p>
                                    <p>Purpose: The Add-on needs to read the structure of the Google Form it is currently running in to understand the questions and fields available for pre-filling. It also needs to create/modify form URLs or parameters to generate the pre-filled links for that specific form.</p>
                                    <p>Specific Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.currentonly (See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Form you are using with this app).</p>
                                    <p>Limited Use: Our access is strictly limited to the Google Form that is currently open and being used with the Add-on. We do not access or process any other forms in your Google Drive.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Google Drive Files (Read-Only Access):</strong></p>
                                    <p>Purpose: The Add-on may need to read metadata (like file names, types) of files in your Google Drive. This is typically used to help you select specific Google Sheets or Forms for pre-filling, or to verify file types if you provide URLs. It does not allow the Add-on to modify, create, or delete any files in your Drive.</p>
                                    <p>Specific Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly (See and download all your Google Drive files).</p>
                                    <p>Limited Use: This access is used only for identifying and listing files to facilitate selection within the Add-on's interface. We do not download the content of files other than the explicitly selected Google Sheets or Forms, nor do we modify any Drive files.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Gmail (Manage Drafts and Send Emails):</strong></p>
                                    <p>Purpose: If the Add-on includes a feature to send pre-filled form links via email (e.g., to respondents), it will require permission to manage drafts and send emails on your behalf. Your email address (obtained via userinfo.email scope) will be used as the "from" address for these emails.</p>
                                    <p>Specific Scopes:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose (Create, read, update, and delete drafts. Send messages and drafts.)</li>
                                        <li>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send (Send messages only. No read or modify privileges on mailbox.)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Limited Use: This access is used only for sending emails as directly initiated by you through the Add-on's features. We do not read your other emails or use this access for any other purpose.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Google Apps Script UI (User Interface):</strong></p>
                                    <p>Purpose: This scope allows the Add-on to display user interface elements, such as sidebars, dialogs, and menus, within the Google Workspace application (e.g., Google Forms, Google Sheets). It does not involve direct access to your data but is necessary for the Add-on's interactive components to function.</p>
                                    <p>Specific Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui (Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications).</p>

                                    <p><strong>Information collected automatically (non-personal):</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymized and aggregated data about how the Add-on is used (e.g., features accessed, number of pre-fills generated, errors encountered). This data helps us understand usage patterns, diagnose issues, and improve the Add-on's functionality. This data is not linked to your personal identity.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Error Logs:</strong> In the event of an error, the Add-on may log technical information (e.g., stack traces, function names) to help us identify and fix bugs. These logs are primarily stored in Google's Cloud Logging infrastructure and do not contain personal user data unless explicitly provided by the user for support purposes.</p>
